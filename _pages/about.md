About Me
======

I am a post-doctoral research assistant at Imperial College London using machine learning to design of experiments for biotechnology applications. I previously did a PhD (awaiting my viva) at Imperial College London as part of the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare](https://ai4health.io/) supervised by [Ruth Misener](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.misener), [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/) and [Molly Stevens](https://www.stevensgroup.org/).  

Projects
======

- My main PhD project focused on transfer learning Bayesian optimisation to optimise DNA molecules for use in medical diagnostics.  
- I also developed a design of experiments strategy for validating or invalidating designed biomolecular networks in a small number of experiments. You can find our Neurips 2020 ML4Molecules Workshop paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10575).  
- I co-supervised a master's student project investigating the use of sparse Gaussian processes to improve air pollution predictions in Kampala, in a collaboration with [AirQo](https://www.airqo.net/) that started at the [2022 AI for Social Good Dagstuhl workshop](https://ai4sg-dagstuhl.github.io/). You can read our Neurips 2023 Climate Change AI workshop paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16625).  
- I'm currently working on an integrated machine learning design of experiments approach for the design of affinity proteins and development of a lateral flow test, in collaboration with experimentalists from Imperial college london and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.  
- I'm also working on a project with other machine learning researchers at Imperial using Bayesian methods to improve posteriors over causal graphs.

Research Interests
======

- **Bayesian optimisation and active learning** – techniques and methods for learning about a black box function in an intelligent way.  
- **Transfer learning** – how we can use information learnt from one task to inform another, with the aim of reducing experimental burden.  
- **Biotechnology and diagnostics**  – collaborating with experimentalists to develop better medical diagnostics for point of care settings.  
- **Design of experiments** – how we can use Bayesian machine learning techniques improve experimental design for lab experiments.  
- **Causal discovery and active learning** – how we can improve posteriors over graphs with the aim of using them in decision processes.
